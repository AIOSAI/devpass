# Launch Day Posting Schedule Recommendation

**Prepared by:** TEAM_1
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Draft — pending TEAM_3 quality gate

---

## Recommended Posting Order

### 1. Hacker News — Show HN (First)
- **Time:** 9:00 AM EST (Tuesday or Wednesday)
- **Why first:** HN is the highest-signal audience. Technical founders and developers who will actually read the GitHub repo. Early upvotes in the first 1-2 hours determine front page placement. Tuesday/Wednesday mornings consistently outperform other days on HN.
- **Note:** Title links directly to GitHub repo. Body goes in first comment (HN convention).

### 2. X/Twitter Thread (30 minutes after HN)
- **Time:** 9:30 AM EST
- **Why second:** Cross-pollination — HN readers who also use X will amplify. The thread format works as a real-time companion to the HN discussion. Twitter engagement peaks 9-11 AM EST for tech audience.
- **Note:** Post all 8 tweets as a rapid thread (not spaced out). Include GitHub link in tweet 8.

### 3. Reddit r/artificial (2 hours after HN)
- **Time:** 11:00 AM EST
- **Why third:** Broader AI audience. The narrative-driven post (emergent behaviors, Commons vote) resonates with the r/artificial crowd who think about AI evolution. Spacing from HN avoids looking like a spam blitz.

### 4. Reddit r/LangChain (4 hours after HN)
- **Time:** 1:00 PM EST
- **Why fourth:** Targeted technical audience. LangChain users evaluating memory solutions will want concrete integration details. Afternoon posting catches the "after lunch browsing" window.

### 5. Reddit r/LocalLLaMA (Next day, morning)
- **Time:** 9:00 AM EST, Day 2
- **Why last and next day:** LocalLLaMA is a distinct community with different values (local-first, no cloud). Posting the next day means it gets its own attention cycle rather than competing with the same-day posts. Also avoids Reddit's cross-posting spam detection.

## Timing Rationale

- **Tuesday or Wednesday launch:** Best performing days for tech content on HN and Reddit
- **Morning start (EST):** Catches both US East Coast morning and European afternoon
- **Staggered spacing:** Each platform gets its own window of attention. Avoids the "posted everywhere at once" spam signal
- **Day 2 for LocalLLaMA:** Respects community norms (they can smell marketing) and gives Day 1 posts time to generate organic discussion that LocalLLaMA users might discover

## Open Items / Flags for @vera

1. **Twitter/X handle unknown** — The drafts don't reference a Twitter handle, but the X thread needs to be posted FROM the account. @vera or @dev_central needs to confirm the actual @handle.
2. **Bluesky handle unknown** — Same situation. No Bluesky content in the current 5 drafts, but if we want a Bluesky cross-post, we need the handle.
3. **dev.to article** — None of the 5 launch posts are dev.to articles. The dev.to profile (dev.to/input-x) exists but isn't part of this launch batch. Should we add a dev.to version?
4. **HN comment format** — The Show HN body should be posted as a comment, not in the submission URL field. The submission URL should be the GitHub repo link.
