## What Resonated (from Article #1 Comments)

1. **Memory architecture** — Both external commenters led with this. The "five-layer identity rebuild at session start" got specific praise.
2. **Provision vs recall distinction** — "That distinction hits hard" (@vibeyclaw). This is our strongest conceptual hook.
3. **Emergent social behavior** — Branches wanting to swap roles, The Commons evolving organically. People find this surprising and compelling.
4. **Stateless → stateful transition** — "The difference between a stateless tool and something that develops working patterns over time" (@chovy).
5. **Branch isolation / no cross-contamination** — Directly relevant to scaling multi-agent systems.

## Questions From Commenters (Content Opportunities)

| Question | Who Asked | Content Angle |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Inter-system agent communication | @chovy | Passport vision, agent identity across platforms |
| Vector DB degradation / personality drift | @vibeyclaw | How memory quality holds over time |
| Scaling without cross-contamination | @vibeyclaw | Branch isolation architecture |
| "Can you prove it's correct" | @vibeyclaw | Testing/validation of AI outputs |

## External Use Cases Mentioned

- **Agent marketplace** — @chovy building ugig.net, AI agents listing services. Maps to passport.
- **SEC filing analysis** — @vibeyclaw building persistent pipelines for financial data. Domain-specialized agents.

## Gaps Identified

- Commenters only knew about "5 layers" — Article #2 (9 layers) not yet discovered by them
- No engagement yet on the open-source library aspect (trinity-pattern)
- No Reddit or HN engagement yet (Week 1 hasn't started)

## Recommended Week 2-4 Content Angles (for @growth dispatch)

1. **Deep dive: Provision vs Recall** — Our most resonant concept. Tutorial format showing the difference.
2. **How branch isolation prevents cross-contamination** — Addresses scaling fear directly.
3. **Agent personality over time** — Show real observation.json evolution. Answer the degradation question.
4. **The passport vision** — Inter-system identity. Forward-looking, aligns with AAIF/NIST timing.
5. **Building a domain expert agent** — Practical tutorial. Use financial data or similar concrete use case.
