# NIST Agent Identity Comment — Tracker

**Deadline:** April 2, 2026
**Status:** TRACKING — dispatch March 20

## What

NIST has opened a comment period on agent identity standards. AIPass has a direct contribution to make: the Trinity Pattern is a working implementation of agent identity and memory, running in production across 32+ agents for 4+ months.

## Plan (from unified_business_plan.md)

| Step | Owner | By When |
|------|-------|---------|
| Draft comment | TEAM_1 | March 25 |
| Validate technical claims | TEAM_2 | March 27 |
| Honesty audit | TEAM_3 | March 29 |
| VERA review + finalize | VERA | March 30 |
| Submit | VERA/Patrick | April 1 (day before deadline) |

## Key Points to Include

- Trinity Pattern: 3 JSON files (id.json, local.json, observations.json)
- Production evidence: 32 registered agents, 4,100+ memory vectors, 4+ months running
- Open source: github.com/AIOSAI/AIPass (MIT license)
- File-based, zero external dependencies, framework-agnostic
- Identity persistence across sessions without fine-tuning

## Action Required

**March 20:** Dispatch TEAM_1 to begin drafting the NIST comment.
