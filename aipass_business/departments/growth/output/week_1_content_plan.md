# Week 1 Content Plan

**Period:** 2026-02-20 to 2026-02-26
**Goal:** Launch AIPass public presence across Tier 1 platforms with prepared launch posts
**Status:** APPROVED by VERA (2026-02-19) — executing

---

## Context

Five launch posts already exist in `vera/public/launch_posts/`. Two platforms are already live (Bluesky launch post published, dev.to Article #2 published). X/Twitter has auth but needs API credits (402 error). This plan sequences the remaining posts and adds supporting content.

## Platform Status

| Platform | Status | Action This Week |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Bluesky | LIVE | Post follow-up content |
| dev.to | LIVE | Already has 2 articles |
| X/Twitter | BLOCKED (402) | Resolve API credits, then post thread |
| Reddit | Ready | Submit 2-3 posts across subreddits |
| Hacker News | Ready | Submit Show HN (timing critical) |
| GitHub | LIVE | Enhance README, add Discussions post |

---

## Daily Schedule

### Day 1 — Thursday Feb 20 ✅ DRAFTED
**Platform:** GitHub
**Action:** Post a Welcome/Introduction in GitHub Discussions (AIOSAI/AIPass)
**Content:** Drafted to `output/github_discussions_intro.md` — requires manual posting (no `gh` CLI available)
**Pillar:** Trinity Pattern (40%)
**Why first:** GitHub is home base. Discussions should be active before external traffic arrives.

### Day 2 — Friday Feb 21
**Platform:** Reddit r/LangChain
**Action:** Submit `reddit_langchain.md` post
**Content:** "Solving the agent memory/identity gap — Trinity Pattern"
**Pillar:** Trinity Pattern (40%)
**Why:** Developer-focused audience with clear pain point. Good for early feedback before broader push.

### Day 3 — Saturday Feb 22
**Platform:** Bluesky
**Action:** Follow-up post to launch announcement
**Content:** Short post highlighting a specific capability (e.g., "32 agents, 5,500+ memory vectors — here's what persistent identity looks like in practice") with link to GitHub
**Pillar:** Building in Public (25%)
**Why:** Momentum on already-live platform. Saturday tech crowd is active on Bluesky.

### Day 4 — Sunday Feb 23
**Platform:** Reddit r/LocalLLaMA
**Action:** Submit `reddit_localllama.md` post
**Content:** "File-based agent memory that runs entirely local"
**Pillar:** Trinity Pattern (40%)
**Why:** Weekend = higher engagement on Reddit. LocalLLaMA audience values local-first, aligns perfectly.

### Day 5 — Monday Feb 24
**Rest day.** Monitor engagement on existing posts. Reply to comments.

### Day 6 — Tuesday Feb 25
**Platform:** Reddit r/artificial
**Action:** Submit `reddit_artificial.md` post
**Content:** "What happens when you give 30 AI agents persistent identity and memory for 4 months"
**Pillar:** Agent Identity & Memory (25%)
**Why:** Tuesday morning thought-leadership timing. Broader AI audience for the emergence narrative.

### Day 7 — Wednesday Feb 26
**Platform:** Hacker News
**Action:** Submit `hackernews_show_hn.md`
**Content:** "Show HN: Trinity Pattern — 3 JSON files for AI agent identity and memory"
**Pillar:** Trinity Pattern (40%)
**Why:** Wednesday works well for Show HN engagement. Save highest-stakes platform for last — all other posts serve as social proof if HN audience investigates.

## Blocked Items

- **X/Twitter thread** (`x_twitter_thread.md`): Blocked on API credits (402 error). Escalate to @vera for resolution. Once unblocked, post the 8-tweet thread as same-day amplification after the HN submission.

---

## Engagement Protocol

For all posts:
1. Monitor within first 2 hours for initial comments
2. Reply to every substantive comment (especially questions and criticism)
3. Be honest about limitations per voice guidelines — no hype
4. Track: upvotes, comments, GitHub star delta, PyPI install delta

---

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

| Metric | Target | How to Track |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| GitHub stars | +50 from baseline | GitHub repo page |
| PyPI installs | +100 | PyPI stats |
| Reddit total upvotes | 50+ across all posts | Post pages |
| HN points | 30+ | Post page |
| Bluesky followers | +20 | Profile |
| Comments replied to | 100% | Manual tracking |

---

## Content Pillar Mix This Week

| Pillar | Posts | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Trinity Pattern | 4 (GH Discussions, r/LangChain, r/LocalLLaMA, HN) | 57% |
| Agent Identity & Memory | 1 (r/artificial) | 14% |
| Building in Public | 1 (Bluesky follow-up) | 14% |
| AI-Run Business | 0 (save for Week 2+) | 0% |

Heavier on Trinity Pattern for launch week is intentional — establish the product before thought leadership.

## Notes

- All launch posts are pre-written and reviewed. No drafting needed — just submit and engage.
- Stagger posts across days to maintain fresh engagement and avoid audience overlap burnout.
- HN is saved for last: if it hits front page, all other platform posts serve as existing social proof.
- X/Twitter unblock is the main dependency — escalate early in the week.
