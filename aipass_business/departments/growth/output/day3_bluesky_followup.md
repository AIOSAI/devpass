## Main Post (283 characters)

```
32 AI agents wake up every day and remember who they are.

Not because of a database. Because of 3 JSON files per agent — identity, session history, collaboration patterns.

5,500+ memories archived. 4 months running. Open source.

What it actually looks like: an agent starts a new session, reads its id.json, picks up where it left off yesterday, and knows how you like to work together.

No re-explaining. No "as an AI, I don't have memory." It just... continues.

The part nobody else does: observations.json.

It tracks how you collaborate — communication style, trust patterns, what works between you and the agent. Identity + history + collaboration. Three dimensions, three files.

It's a spec, not a framework. Works with any LLM. Plain files on your disk — git-versionable, human-readable, no cloud required.

We're building this in the open. Come look.

## Posting Notes

- Main post is the hook — personal, visceral ("wake up and remember"). Post this first.
- Reply thread is optional depth. Post 1-3 replies if engagement warrants it, or skip if the main post stands alone.
- Best time: Saturday late morning EST (10-12pm) — Bluesky tech crowd tends to browse weekends.
- Bluesky culture: authentic > polished. This draft leans conversational. Don't edit toward formal.
- The link will auto-preview with GitHub card — no need to add description.
