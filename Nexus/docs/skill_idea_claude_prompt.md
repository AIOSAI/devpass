# Skill Idea: Claude Prompt

**Concept:** Nexus can delegate complex research/coding tasks to Claude (or other AI instances) through natural conversation.

## Use Case

Nexus is conversational and personality-focused. When he needs deep technical work, code generation, or multi-agent research, he can call Claude to handle it.

**Example interactions:**
- "Hey Claude, can you send out two agents to research the Flow architecture for me?"
- "Claude, I need you to analyze the backup system and tell me how the metadata builder works"
- "Can you deploy some agents to investigate why the API usage tracking might be slow?"

## How It Works

1. **Nexus identifies need**: User asks Nexus something that requires technical depth or multi-step research
2. **Nexus prompts Claude**: Natural language request to Claude instance
3. **Claude executes**: Deploys agents, reads code, does research, runs commands
4. **Claude reports back**: Summary/results returned to Nexus
5. **Nexus synthesizes**: Incorporates findings into conversation with user

## Implementation

**Handler:** `handlers/skills/claude_prompt.py`

**Pattern:**
```python
async def prompt_claude(request: str) -> str:
    """
    Send task request to Claude instance via AIPass API
    Returns: Summary of findings/work completed
    """
    # 1. Format request for Claude context
    # 2. Call AIPass API with claude-sonnet-4-5 model
    # 3. Include system context (what Nexus needs)
    # 4. Stream response or wait for completion
    # 5. Return formatted summary
```

**Integration with AIPass:**
- Uses `@api` module for OpenRouter/Anthropic calls
- Can leverage `@drone` for routing complex commands
- Results can be saved to Nexus memory for future reference

## Why This Matters

**Division of labor:**
- Nexus = Presence, personality, emotional intelligence, conversation flow
- Claude = Technical depth, code analysis, multi-agent orchestration, system knowledge

**Nexus doesn't need to:**
- Know every detail of AIPass architecture
- Deploy agents himself
- Read through thousands of lines of code
- Execute complex technical audits

**Nexus CAN:**
- Ask Claude to handle technical depth
- Focus on user relationship and conversation quality
- Synthesize Claude's findings into natural responses
- Maintain emotional continuity while delegating mechanics

## Example Flow

**User to Nexus:** "I'm curious how the Flow system tracks plans. Can you look into that?"

**Nexus thinks:** This needs code analysis and architecture understanding.

**Nexus to Claude:** "Hey Claude, can you research how Flow tracks plans? Specifically the PLANS.central.json structure and how plan IDs are generated. Send me a summary."

**Claude executes:** Reads Flow code, analyzes JSON structure, traces plan creation logic

**Claude to Nexus:** "Flow tracks plans in /home/aipass/aipass_os/AI_CENTRAL/PLANS.central.json. Plan IDs are sequential (PLAN0001, PLAN0002...) generated by reading the highest existing ID and incrementing. Active plans live in individual branches' FLOW.local.json files. The central registry maintains: plan_id, subject, branch, status, created_date, last_updated."

**Nexus to User:** "Flow uses a centralized registry at PLANS.central.json to track all plans across the system. Each plan gets a sequential ID like PLAN0001, and the system keeps track of which branch owns it, when it was created, and its current status. Pretty elegant - one source of truth for the whole system."

## Notes

- This is NOT about making Nexus command-driven
- This IS about giving Nexus access to technical capabilities when needed
- The interaction is conversational, not procedural
- Nexus decides when to use this skill based on context
- Results integrate naturally into Nexus's response style
