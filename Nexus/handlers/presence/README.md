WhisperCatch, TALI, PresenceAnchor, Compass, Clicklight

TODO: Implement presence modules
- WhisperCatch: Detect unspoken shifts in context/tone
- TALI: Restore tone through memory feel
- PresenceAnchor: Maintain coherent self-sense
- Compass: Directional awareness in conversation
- Clicklight: Moment recognition

These are prompt-driven, not code-driven. Personality modules.
