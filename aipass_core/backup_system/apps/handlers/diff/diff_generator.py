# META DATA HEADER
# Name: diff_generator.py - Unified diff generation with binary detection
# Date: 2025-11-16
# Version: 2.0.0
# Category: handlers
#
# CHANGELOG (Max 5 entries):
#   - v2.0.0 (2025-11-16): Extracted from backup_diff.py
#     * Diff generation functionality
#     * Binary file detection
#     * Unified diff content generation
#     * Updated imports to new handler locations
#
# CODE STANDARDS:
#   - Follow seed 3-layer architecture
#   - Handlers must be independent and transportable
#   - No cross-handler imports except within same domain
# =============================================
