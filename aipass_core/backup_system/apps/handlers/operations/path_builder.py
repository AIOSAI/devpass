# Name: path_builder.py - Backup path construction
# Date: 2025-11-18
# Version: 1.0.0
# Category: handlers
#
# CHANGELOG (Max 5 entries):
#   - v1.0.0 (2025-11-18): Extracted from backup_core.py
#     * Extracted path construction logic for versioned mode
#     * Handles long filename hashing
#     * Mode-specific path building
#
# CODE STANDARDS:
#   - Follow seed 3-layer architecture
#   - Handlers must be independent and transportable
#   - No cross-handler imports except within same domain
