"""
Inbox File Lock Handler

Provides exclusive file locking for inbox.json read-modify-write operations.
Uses fcntl.flock (POSIX advisory locks) to prevent concurrent write corruption.

Usage:
    with inbox_lock(inbox_file):
        data = json.load(open(inbox_file, encoding='utf-8'))
        # ... modify data ...
        json.dump(data, open(inbox_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8'))

    Context manager that acquires an exclusive lock on an inbox.json file.

    Uses a separate .inbox.lock file adjacent to inbox.json to hold the
    fcntl.flock advisory lock. This avoids issues with truncating the
    locked file itself during writes.

    Args:
        inbox_file: Path to the inbox.json file to lock

    Yields:
        None - lock is held for the duration of the with block

    Raises:
