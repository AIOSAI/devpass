Registry Read Handler

Handles reading branch registry data including:
- Reading all branches from BRANCH_REGISTRY.json
- Deriving email addresses from branch names
- Mapping email addresses to branch paths

Handler Independence:
- No module imports from ai_mail
- Only uses Prax logger and standard library
- Fully transportable and self-contained
