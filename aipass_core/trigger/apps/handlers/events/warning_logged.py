Warning Logged Event Handler

Handles warning_logged events fired by Trigger log watcher.
Logs warning for monitoring but does not send notifications
(warnings are informational, not actionable by default).

Event data expected:
    - branch: Branch where warning occurred
    - message: Warning message text
    - error_hash: Unique hash for deduplication
    - timestamp: When the warning occurred
    - log_file: Path to log file
    - module_name: Module that logged the warning
    - level: Log level (always 'warning' for this handler)
