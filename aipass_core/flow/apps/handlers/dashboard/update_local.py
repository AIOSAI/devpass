Update Dashboard Local Handler

Updates Flow's DASHBOARD.local.json file with plan summaries from flow_registry.json.

This handler follows the 3-tier logging standard:
- NO Prax imports
- NO logging calls
- Pure handler - just read, process, write
- Returns boolean for success/failure

Flow's Dual Role:
- Flow is both a working branch (has its own plans) AND a service provider
- This handler manages Flow's OWN plans in DASHBOARD.local.json
- Flow's section is 'flow_plans', other branches manage their own sections
- Key principle: Each branch touches ONLY its own section, respects others

Data Flow:
1. Read flow_registry.json (source of truth)
2. Extract Flow's plans only (location='flow')
3. Partition into active (status='open') and recently_closed (status='closed', last 5)
4. Calculate statistics (active_count, total_closed, next_number)
5. Read existing DASHBOARD.local.json if exists
6. Update ONLY the 'flow_plans' section
7. Preserve ALL other sections (other branches manage their own)
8. Write back to DASHBOARD.local.json

Structure:
{
  "branch": "FLOW",
  "last_updated": "ISO timestamp",
  "flow_plans": {
    "active": [
      {
        "plan_id": "FPLAN-0021",
        "subject": "...",
        "status": "open",
        "created": "ISO timestamp",
        "file_path": "...",
        "location": "flow"
      }
    ],
    "recently_closed": [ /* last 5 closed plans */ ],
    "statistics": {
      "active_count": 3,
      "total_closed": 6,
      "next_number": 24
    }
  }
  // Other sections preserved here
}

Usage:
    from flow.apps.handlers.dashboard.update_local import update_dashboard_local

    success = update_dashboard_local()
    if success:
        print("Dashboard updated successfully")
    else:
