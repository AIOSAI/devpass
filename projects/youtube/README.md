# YouTube - AI Influencer Project

An AI persona as the face of AIPass content on YouTube. Transparent about being AI - documenting the real journey of human-AI collaboration.

## Status: Idea Stage

Captured from Telegram brainstorming session (Feb 2026). Research and planning needed.

## Concept

An AI character that presents AIPass development content - build logs, architecture decisions, philosophy, demos. Not pretending to be human. The honesty IS the brand.
