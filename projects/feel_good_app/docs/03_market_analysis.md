# Market Analysis: Mood + Biometric Health Tracking

## The Gap - CONFIRMED

Patrick's instinct is correct. No single app combines:
1. Rich subjective mood logging (granular emotions, not just good/bad)
2. Contextual tags (at home, at work, out with friends)
3. Passive biometric data from smart rings/wearables
4. AI-powered pattern recognition and correlation
5. Smart ring as first-class feature

## Competitive Landscape

### Pure Mood Trackers (no biometrics)
| App | Strength | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Daylio | Two-tap entry, custom moods/activities | No biometrics, no wearables, no AI |
| Bearable | Best correlations, symptom tracking | Chronic illness focus, statistical only (no AI), no direct ring support |
| Exist.io | Multi-source aggregation | Basic mood scale, no AI, small team |
| Finch | Emotional granularity, gamification | Self-care companion, no biometrics |
| MoodKit | CBT-based tools | Therapy tool, no data integration |
| eMoods | Clinical (bipolar), PDF reports | Manual entry only |

### Biometric/Wearable Apps (weak on mood)
| App | Biometrics | Mood Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Oura | Excellent (HR, HRV, sleep, temp, SpO2) | Basic tags only, no structured mood scale |
| WHOOP | Excellent + Journal feature | Journal is closest to mood logging but fitness-focused |
| Apple Health | Comprehensive aggregation | Basic mood tracker (iOS 17+), shallow correlations |
| Samsung Health | Good via Galaxy Watch/Ring | Lightweight mindfulness feature |

### Bridge Attempts (trying to do both)
| App | What They Do | Why They Fall Short |
|---|---|---|
| Bearable | Mood + symptoms + Apple Health/Fitbit sync | Statistical correlations only, no AI, chronic illness UX |
| Exist.io | Multi-source aggregation + daily mood | Basic mood (no granularity), no AI, no ring support |
| Gyroscope | Comprehensive health dashboard + AI coaching | $200+/year, physical health focus, not mood-centric |
| Welltory | HRV-focused + lifestyle factors | Physiological stress only, no structured mood |

## The AI Gap (Our Differentiator)

This is the real opportunity. Multiple apps can collect the data. NONE use AI to:
- Learn personal patterns over time
- Surface non-obvious correlations (e.g., "When your HRV drops below X and you're at work, 73% chance of reporting stressed mood next morning")
- Proactively notify users of insights
- Distinguish between physiological stress and subjective emotional state

Most "correlations" in existing apps are basic statistics, not machine learning.

## User Pain Points (from reviews)
- Too much manual entry -> adherence drops
- Shallow insights ("you were happier on walking days" - obvious)
- Walled gardens (WHOOP data stays in WHOOP, Oura stays in Oura)
- No AI that actually learns
- Missing wearable integrations
- Confusing statistics without explanation

## Market Size
- Mood tracker app market: $1.5B (2024) -> $5.7B by 2033 (16.5% CAGR)
- AI in mental health market: growing at 32% CAGR -> $25.1B by 2034
- Intersection of both = underserved and growing fast

## Monetization Models
- **Freemium + Subscription**: $5-12/month or $35-70/year (dominant model)
- **Sweet spot**: $30-70/year for premium features
- **Free tier with real utility** drives adoption
- **Annual pricing** with discount drives commitment
- Premium tiers: AI insights, unlimited history, export, advanced correlations
- Future: B2B licensing to therapists/clinicians, employer wellness programs

## What We Should Learn From
- **Daylio's two-tap entry**: If logging takes >10 seconds, people stop
- **Oura's passive collection**: Ring just works in the background
- **Bearable's correlation engine**: Users find real value in seeing patterns
- **Finch's emotional granularity**: Naming specific emotions matters therapeutically
