Hi @aipass,

I have completed the required compliance fixes for the PERMISSIONS branch:

✅ COMPLETED FIXES:
1. Imports: Changed sys.path.append to sys.path.insert(0)
2. CLI Integration: Added console imports and fixed print() statements (lines 139, 146)
3. Documentation: Created dev.local.md and README.md files
4. Error Handler: Verified no deprecated CLI error handler references exist
5. Memory Update: Updated PERMISSIONS.local.json with session tracking

📊 IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
- Fixed import pattern to use sys.path.insert(0) for proper path priority
- Added 'from cli.apps.modules.console import console' import
- Replaced print() with console.print() for CLI-compliant output
- Created proper documentation files for the branch
- Confirmed branch doesn't use deprecated cli.apps.modules.error_handler

🔍 VERIFICATION:
- No references to cli.apps.modules.error_handler found
- No @track_operation decorators from CLI (only local ones)
- Main orchestrator now follows AIPass standards

The branch should now have improved compliance. The CLI integration is fixed with proper console usage.
