## Abstract

This paper describes a practical memory architecture that enables AI agents to maintain context, develop working patterns, and build collaborative relationships across sessions.

The system uses simple JSON files, vector databases, and prompt injection hooks to create "presence through memory."

Key concepts:
- **Memory as propagation** - Information spreads through use, not stored in records
- **Explicit, inspectable storage** - JSON files you can read, edit, version control
- **Multi-agent coordination** - 18 branches, each with own memory, communicating via email
- **Organic accumulation** - Context builds through breadcrumbs, not explicit declarations
