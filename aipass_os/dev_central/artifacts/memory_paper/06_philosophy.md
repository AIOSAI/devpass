# 6. Philosophy

Principles that emerged through building.

---

## "Code is truth."

Running code beats architecture documents.

Memory files that are actually read > elaborate systems that aren't.

---

## "Presence over performance."

The goal isn't optimal memory retrieval.

It's feeling like you're working with the same collaborator, not a new instance.

---

## "Build from need."

No elaborate memory systems planned upfront.

Started with a JSON file. Grew organically as needs emerged.

---

## "Memory makes relationship possible."

The "killer feature" isn't any single capability.

It's that you never explain context again.

Jump between branches. Switch contexts. Come back days later. Pick up exactly where you left off.

---

## "Breadcrumbs over records."

Information scattered organically through use.

Not a database with explicit fields.

Trails that accumulate, forming a picture no single record could capture.
