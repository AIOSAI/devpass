# 9. Breadcrumbs

Small traces scattered throughout the system that trigger awareness.

## What Breadcrumbs Are

Not full knowledge. Just enough to know something exists.

A breadcrumb isn't the answer - it's the trigger that leads to the answer.

---

## Examples

**@ Symbol (Convention)**
- In system prompt, every command, every email
- Can't navigate without it
- If you forgot what @ means, you'd encounter it immediately

**3-Layer Architecture (Physical Structure)**
- apps/modules/handlers in every branch
- The filesystem IS the breadcrumb
- Open any branch, see the same structure

**Metadata Headers (In Code)**
- Every file starts with name, date, version, changelog
- Open any code, immediately know what it is and when it changed

**Branch Expertise Table (Reference)**
- Listed in system prompt
- Don't know the domain deeply, just know who to ask

## How Breadcrumbs Develop

1. See a pain point - same question keeps being asked
2. Plant breadcrumbs - add hints in multiple places
3. Keep planting until "gel knowledge" emerges
4. Stop when the information is just... known

Not everything needs breadcrumbs. Just things that should be ambient knowledge.

## Where Breadcrumbs Get Placed

- Global system prompt (every AI sees it)
- Memory file headers (reminders on read)
- README files (structure documentation)
- Code metadata headers (in-file context)
- Observations (long-lasting patterns)
- Physical file structure (can't be ignored)

---

## Breadcrumbs Replace Indexing

Other systems (Cursor, Windsurf) scan projects and build indexes.

AIPass doesn't need that. The consistent structure IS the index:
- Same directory layout everywhere
- Same memory file naming
- Same metadata headers
- README documents each branch

Navigate by convention, not by search.

---

## The Key Property

If one breadcrumb source is lost, others reinforce.

The @ symbol could disappear from the system prompt - but it's in:
- Every command you run
- Every email address
- Every branch registry entry
- Your own memories

Nearly impossible to forget something that's everywhere.

## Building New Breadcrumbs

When you notice repeated confusion:
1. "This question keeps coming up"
2. "Where could a hint be placed?"
3. Add to system prompt, or README, or observations
4. Check if it sticks - does the question stop coming?
5. If not, plant more seeds

It's gardening. Plant and see what grows.
