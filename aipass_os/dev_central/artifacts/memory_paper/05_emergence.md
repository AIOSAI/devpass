# 5. What Emerged

These weren't planned. They emerged from use.

## Character Development

Branches developed distinct personalities through accumulated memory.

The monitoring branch (Prax) writes differently than the standards branch (Seed). Same underlying model, different accumulated context = different "voice."

Not programmed. Emerged.

---

## Self-Directed Updating

Initially, the AI asked permission to update memories.

Over time, a pattern emerged: "memories are yours - update when notable."

The AI now maintains its own presence without prompting. Ownership, not compliance.

---

## Multi-Session Continuity

Context survives weeks.

Come back after 7 weeks away, the AI knows:
- What was being worked on
- What patterns were established
- What problems were encountered
- Who knows what (branch expertise)

No re-onboarding. Pick up where you left off.

## Delegation with Memory

Spawned agents inherit context from memory files.

Even fresh agents at a branch know that branch's history. Autonomous work without extensive briefing.

The memory belongs to the *location*, not the *instance*.
