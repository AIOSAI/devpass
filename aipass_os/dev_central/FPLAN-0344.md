# FPLAN-0344 - Telegram Bot Standards - Shared base commands for all bots (MASTER PLAN)

**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Branch**: /home/aipass/aipass_os/dev_central
**Status**: Active
**Type**: Master Plan (Multi-Phase)

---

## What Are Flow Plans?

Flow Plans (FPLANs) are for **BUILDING** - autonomous construction of systems, features, modules. They're the structured way to execute work without constant human oversight.

**This is NOT for:**
- Research or exploration (use agents directly)
- Quick fixes (just do it)
- Discussion or planning (that happens before creating the FPLAN)

**This IS for:**
- Building new branches/modules
- Implementing features
- Multi-phase construction projects
- Autonomous execution

---

## Master Plan vs Default Plan

| | Master Plan | Default Plan |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| **Use when** | 3+ phases, complex build | Single focused task |
| **Structure** | Roadmap + sub-plans | Self-contained |
| **Phases** | Multiple, sequential | One |
| **Sub-plans** | Yes, one per phase | No |
| **Typical use** | Build entire branch | One phase of master |

**Pattern:**
```
Master Plan (roadmap)
├── Sub-plan Phase 1 (default template)
├── Sub-plan Phase 2 (default template)
├── Sub-plan Phase 3 (default template)
└── Sub-plan Phase 4 (default template)
```

**How to start:**
1. DEV_CENTRAL provides planning doc or instructions
2. Branch manager reads and understands scope
3. Branch manager creates master plan: `drone @flow create . "Build X" master`
4. Branch manager fills in phases, then executes autonomously

---

## Critical: Branch Manager Role

**You are the ORCHESTRATOR, not the builder.**

Your 200k context is precious. Burning it on file reads and code writing risks compaction during autonomous work. Agents have clean context - use them for ALL building.

| You Do (Orchestrator) | Agents Do (Builders) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Create plans & sub-plans | Write code |
| Define phases | Run tests |
| Give agent instructions | Read/modify files |
| Review agent output | Research/exploration |
| Course correct | Heavy lifting |
| Update memories | Single-task execution |
| Send status emails | Build deliverables |
| Track phase progress | Quality checks on code |

**Master Plan Pattern:** Define all phases → Create sub-plan for Phase 1 → Deploy agent → Review → Close sub-plan → Email update → Next phase

---

## Seek Branch Expertise

Don't figure everything out alone. Other branches are domain experts - ask them first.

**Before building anything that touches another branch's domain:**
```bash
ai_mail send @branch "Question: [topic]" "I'm working on X and need guidance on Y. What's the best approach?"
```

**Common examples:**
- Building something with email? Ask @ai_mail how delivery works
- Need routing or @ resolution? Ask @drone
- Unsure about standards? Ask @seed for reference code
- Need persistent storage or search? Ask @memory_bank
- Event-driven behavior? Ask @trigger about their event system
- Dashboard integration? Ask @devpulse about update_section()

They have deep memory on their systems. A 1-email question saves you hours of guessing. For master plans spanning multiple domains, identify which branches to consult during phase definitions.

---

## Notepad

Keep `notepad.md` in your branch directory as a shared scratchpad during the build. Use it for:
- **Status updates** - Quick progress lines so Patrick can glance without asking
- **Questions for Patrick** - Non-urgent questions that can wait for his next visit
- **Notes to self** - Decisions made, things to revisit, gotchas discovered

Update it as you work - lightweight, not formal. Patrick checks it when he wants to, skips it when he's busy. Low friction both ways.

```bash
# Create it at plan start
echo "# Notepad - FPLAN-0344" > notepad.md
```

---

## Command Reference

When unsure about syntax, use `--help`:

```bash
# Flow - Plan management
drone @flow create . "Phase X: subject"      # Create sub-plan (. = current dir)
drone @flow create . "subject" master        # Create master plan
drone @flow close FPLAN-XXXX           # Close plan
drone @flow list                       # List active plans
drone @flow status                     # Plan status
drone @flow --help                     # Full help

# Seed - Quality gates
drone @seed checklist <file>           # 10-point check on file
drone @seed audit @branch              # Full branch audit (before master close)
drone @seed --help                     # Full help

# AI_Mail - Status updates
drone @ai_mail send @dev_central "Subject" "Message"
drone @ai_mail inbox                   # Check your inbox
drone @ai_mail --help                  # Full help

# Discovery
drone systems                          # All available modules
drone list @branch                     # Commands for branch
```

## What is a Master Plan?

Master Plans are for **complex multi-phase projects**. You define all phases upfront, then create focused sub-plans for each phase.

**When to use:**
- 3+ distinct sequential phases
- Work spanning multiple sessions
- Need clear phase completion milestones
- Complex builds requiring sustained focus

**Pattern:** Master Plan = Roadmap | Sub-Plans = Focused Execution

## Project Overview

### Goal
All Telegram bots share standard commands from one file. Change `telegram_standards.py` → all bots update. Each bot can add custom commands on top. Assistant/test bots stop being copy-paste clones.

### Reference Documentation
- Bridge bot: `/home/aipass/aipass_core/api/apps/handlers/telegram/bridge.py`
- Assistant bot: `/home/aipass/aipass_os/dev_central/assistant/apps/handlers/telegram/assistant_chat.py`
- Test bot: `/home/aipass/aipass_os/dev_central/test/apps/handlers/telegram/test_chat.py`
- Stop hook: `/home/aipass/.claude/hooks/telegram_response.py`
- Configs: `/home/aipass/.aipass/*_bot_config.json`

### Success Criteria
1. `/start`, `/help`, `/new`, `/status` work in ALL bot chats
2. One shared file (`telegram_standards.py`) defines standard commands
3. Bridge retains its custom commands (`/switch`, `/list`, `/end`, `/branch`, `/url`)
4. Assistant/test use shared `direct_chat.py` instead of copy-paste
5. Adding a new standard command to `telegram_standards.py` automatically appears in all bots

---

## Branch Directory Structure

Every branch has dedicated directories. Use them correctly:

```
branch/
├── apps/           # Code (modules/, handlers/)
├── tests/          # All test files go here
├── tools/          # Utility scripts, helpers
├── artifacts/      # Agent outputs (reports, logs)
├── docs/           # Documentation
└── logs/           # Execution logs
```

**Rules:**
- Tests → `tests/` (not root, not random locations)
- Tools/scripts → `tools/`
- Agent artifacts → `artifacts/`
- Create subdirs if needed: `mkdir -p artifacts/reports artifacts/logs`
- **Never delete** - DEV_CENTRAL manages cleanup
- Future: artifacts auto-roll to Memory Bank

---

## Phase Definitions

Define ALL phases before starting work:

### Phase 1: Build telegram_standards.py
**Goal:** Create the shared standards file that defines standard commands, help text, response templates, and a command registry pattern
**Agent Task:** Build `/home/aipass/aipass_core/api/apps/handlers/telegram/telegram_standards.py` with:
- Standard command definitions (name, description, handler logic for /start, /help, /new, /status)
- Response templates (welcome message, status format, error formats, processing message)
- Help text auto-builder (combines standard + custom commands into /help output)
- stdlib-only implementations (must work in both async python-telegram-bot AND sync urllib bots)
- BotFather command menu builder (generates setMyCommands payload)
**Deliverables:** `telegram_standards.py`

### Phase 2: Build direct_chat.py (replaces assistant/test copy-paste)
**Goal:** Create a single config-driven direct chat handler that replaces both assistant_chat.py and test_chat.py
**Agent Task:** Build `/home/aipass/aipass_core/api/apps/handlers/telegram/direct_chat.py` that:
- Takes config params (branch_name, session_name, config_path, work_dir, log_dir)
- Imports and registers standard commands from telegram_standards.py
- Accepts optional custom_commands dict for bot-specific commands
- Handles the full polling loop, tmux injection, pending file coordination
- Replaces ~500 lines of duplicated code with one reusable module
**Deliverables:** `direct_chat.py`

### Phase 3: Update bridge.py to use standards
**Goal:** Refactor bridge.py to import standard commands from telegram_standards.py instead of hardcoding them
**Agent Task:** Modify `/home/aipass/aipass_core/api/apps/handlers/telegram/bridge.py` to:
- Import standard command handlers from telegram_standards.py
- Keep bridge-specific commands (/switch, /list, /end, /branch, /url) as custom additions
- Use shared response templates and help text builder
- Ensure /help auto-includes both standard and bridge-specific commands
**Deliverables:** Updated `bridge.py`

### Phase 4: Create thin launchers + integration test
**Goal:** Replace assistant_chat.py and test_chat.py with thin launchers that use direct_chat.py, and verify all bots respond to standard commands
**Agent Task:**
- Create new `/home/aipass/aipass_os/dev_central/assistant/apps/handlers/telegram/assistant_chat.py` as thin launcher (~20 lines, imports direct_chat and passes config)
- Create new `/home/aipass/aipass_os/dev_central/test/apps/handlers/telegram/test_chat.py` as thin launcher
- Archive old files first
- Create integration test that verifies standard commands are registered for each bot type
**Deliverables:** Updated launchers, archived originals, test script

## Execution Philosophy

### Autonomous Power-Through

Master plans are for **autonomous execution**. Don't halt production every phase waiting for DEV_CENTRAL review.

**The Pattern:**
- Power through all phases
- Accumulate issues as you go
- Deal with issues at the end
- DEV_CENTRAL reviews final result, not every step

**Why this works:**
- Context is precious - don't burn it chasing bugs
- Complete picture reveals which issues actually matter
- Many "bugs" resolve themselves when later phases complete
- DEV_CENTRAL time is for decisions, not babysitting

### The 2-Attempt Rule

When agent encounters an issue:

```
Attempt 1 → Failed?
    ↓
Attempt 2 → Failed?
    ↓
STOP. Mark as issue. Move on.
```

**Do NOT:**
- Try 5 different approaches
- Go down rabbit holes
- Burn context debugging
- Stop production for every error

**DO:**
- Note the issue clearly
- Note what was tried
- Move to next task
- Let branch manager decide priority

### Critical vs Non-Critical Issues

When you see an issue, decide:

| Question | If YES → | If NO → |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Does this block ALL future phases? | STOP. Investigate. | Continue. |
| Can the system work around this? | Continue. | STOP. Investigate. |
| Is this a syntax/import error? | Quick fix, continue. | - |
| Is this a logic/design problem? | Note it. Continue. | - |

**Critical (stop production):**
- Core module won't import at all
- Database/file system inaccessible
- Fundamental architecture wrong

**Non-critical (note and continue):**
- One command throws error but others work
- Registry not updating properly
- Edge case not handled
- Test failing but code runs

**Pattern:** Note issue → Continue building → Fix at end with complete picture

### False Positives Awareness

Seed audits are helpful but not infallible.

**When Seed flags something:**
1. Check if the code is actually correct from your understanding
2. If you're confident it's right → mark as false positive, move on
3. If you're unsure → note it, continue, review later

**Don't stop production for:**
- Style preferences (comments, spacing)
- Patterns that differ from Seed's but still work
- Checks that don't apply to your context

### Forward Momentum Summary
- **Don't stop to fix bugs during phases** - Note them, keep moving
- **Get complete picture first** - All phases done, THEN systematic fixes
- **Prevents:** Bug-fixing rabbit holes, premature optimization, scope creep
- **DEV_CENTRAL reviews at END** - not every phase

### Production Stop Protocol

If something causes production to STOP (critical blocker), **immediately email DEV_CENTRAL**:

```bash
drone @ai_mail send @dev_central "PRODUCTION STOPPED: FPLAN-0344" "Phase X halted. Issue: [description]. Attempted: [what was tried]. Awaiting guidance."
```

**Never leave a branch stopped without reporting.** DEV_CENTRAL needs visibility into all work.

### Monitoring Resources

For quick status checks and debugging, these resources are available:

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Branch logs | `logs/` directory | Local execution logs |
| JSON tree | `apps/json_templates/` | Module firing status |
| Prax monitor | `drone @prax monitor` | Real-time system events |
| Seed audit | `drone @seed audit @branch` | Code quality check |

Use these when you need to confirm status or investigate issues.

### Agent Deployment Per Phase
Each phase = focused agent deployment:
1. Create sub-plan: `drone @flow create . "Phase X: [name]"`
2. Write agent instructions in sub-plan
3. Deploy agent with single-task focus
4. Review agent output (don't rebuild yourself)
5. Seed checklist on new code
6. Close sub-plan
7. Update memories
8. Email status to @dev_central
9. Next phase

### Agent Preparation (Before Deploying)

Agents can't work blind. They need context before they build.

**Your Prep Work (as orchestrator):**
1. [ ] Know where agent will work (branch path, key directories)
2. [ ] Identify files agent needs to reference or modify
3. [ ] Gather any specs, planning docs, or examples to include
4. [ ] Prepare COMPLETE instructions (agents are stateless)

**Agent's First Task (context building):**
- Agent should explore/read relevant files BEFORE writing code
- "First, read X and Y to understand the current structure"
- "Look at Z for the pattern to follow"
- Context-first, build-second

**What Agents DON'T Have:**
- No prior conversation history
- No memory files loaded automatically
- No knowledge of other branches
- Only what you put in their instructions

**Your instructions determine success - be thorough and specific.**

### Agent Instructions Template
```
You are working at [BRANCH_PATH].

TASK: [Specific single task for this phase]

CONTEXT:
- [What they need to know]
- Reference: [planning docs, existing code to study]
- First, READ the relevant files to understand current structure

DELIVERABLES:
- [Specific file or output expected]
- Tests → tests/
- Reports/logs → artifacts/reports/ or artifacts/logs/

CONSTRAINTS:
- Follow Seed standards (3-layer architecture: apps/modules/handlers)
- Do NOT modify files outside your task scope
- CROSS-BRANCH: Never modify other branches' files unless explicitly authorized by DEV_CENTRAL in the planning doc
- 2-ATTEMPT RULE: If something fails twice, note the issue and move on
- Do NOT go down rabbit holes debugging

WHEN COMPLETE:
- Verify code runs without syntax errors
- List files created/modified
- Note any issues encountered (with what was attempted)
```

## Phase Tracking

### Phase 1: Build telegram_standards.py
- **Status:** Complete
- **Notes:** Built shared standards file with STANDARD_COMMANDS registry, text builders, parse_command(), handle_standard_command(). Stdlib only.

### Phase 2: Build direct_chat.py
- **Status:** Complete
- **Notes:** Config-driven replacement for duplicated assistant/test bots. Integrates standard commands. All existing behavior preserved.

### Phase 3: Update bridge.py
- **Status:** Complete
- **Notes:** Bridge now imports from telegram_standards. Added BRIDGE_CUSTOM_COMMANDS dict. /start and /help use shared builders. /help is now separate handler from /start. Bumped to v4.3.0.

### Phase 4: Thin launchers + module layer
- **Status:** Complete
- **Notes:** Created telegram_chat.py module (public API). Assistant/test are now ~48 line thin launchers importing from module layer. Old files archived. Cross-branch handler guard handled via module re-export pattern.

---

## Issues Log

Track issues here as you encounter them. Don't fix during build - log and continue.

| Phase | Issue | Severity | Attempted | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [description] | Low/Med/High | [what was tried] | Open/Resolved |
| 2 | [description] | Low/Med/High | [what was tried] | Open/Resolved |

**Severity Guide:**
- **High:** Blocks future phases, must fix before continuing
- **Med:** Affects functionality but can work around
- **Low:** Cosmetic, edge case, or false positive

**End of Build:** Review this log. Tackle High→Med→Low. Some Low issues may not need fixing.
