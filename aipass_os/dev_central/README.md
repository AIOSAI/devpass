## What is DEV_CENTRAL?

This is the shared workspace where Patrick and Claude collaborate on system-wide orchestration. Not a code-building branch - a conversation and coordination hub.

**What happens here:**
- System-wide planning and architecture discussions
- Central aggregations (all branch READMEs, plans, notes in one place)
- Cross-branch coordination via @assistant workflow
- Admin operations on the whole ecosystem
- Sub-branches for specific concerns (git_repo, permissions, devpulse, assistant)

**What doesn't happen here:**
- Code building (agents do that in proper branches)
- Heavy file operations (agents handle those)

## Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Limit |
|------|---------|-------|
| `DEV_CENTRAL.id.json` | Shared identity | Permanent |
| `DEV_CENTRAL.local.json` | Session history, key learnings | 800 lines |
| `DEV_CENTRAL.observations.json` | Collaboration patterns | 800 lines |

Increased limits (800 vs standard 600) since this branch is conversation-focused.

---

## Central Aggregations

These files aggregate data from across all branches into one place:

| File | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `readme.central.md` | All branch READMEs | System overview |
| `plans_central.md` | PLANS.central.json | Active workflows |
| `notepad.central.md` | All branch notepads | Notes aggregation |
| `devpulse.central.md` | DEVPULSE.central.json | Dev tracking |

Generated by sync scripts in `devpulse/apps/` directory.

## Sub-branches

Dev_central contains proper sub-branches with full 3-layer architecture:

### ASSISTANT (NEW)
Workflow coordinator - dispatches tasks, monitors responses, handles correction loops.
- Path: `dev_central/assistant/`
- Entry: `apps/assistant.py`
- Commands: `drone @assistant update` (status digest)
- Pattern: Tasks sent with `--reply-to @assistant` route back here for validation

### DEVPULSE
Human notes, dashboard updates, dev tracking.
- Path: `dev_central/devpulse/`
- Entry: `apps/devpulse.py`
- Features: dev.local.md per branch, DASHBOARD.local.json updates

### GIT_REPO
Git operations and repository management.
- Path: `dev_central/git_repo/`

### PERMISSIONS
Access control and permission systems.
- Path: `dev_central/permissions/`

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Assistant-Mediated Workflow
DEV_CENTRAL doesn't monitor every branch reply directly. @assistant handles the feedback loop:

```bash
# Send task with reply routing
ai_mail send @branch "Task Subject" "Description" --reply-to @assistant --auto-execute

# Check in when ready
drone @assistant update
```

### Branch Expertise
Before debugging yourself, ask who owns that domain:

| Domain | Branch |
|--------|--------|
| File monitoring | @prax |
| Email system | @ai_mail |
| Standards | @seed |
| Plans/workflows | @flow |
| Command routing | @drone |
| Branch lifecycle | @cortex |
| Backups | @backup_system |
| API access | @api |
| Vector search | @memory_bank |
| Human notes | @devpulse |

See `dev_planning/workflow/claude_p_workflow.md` for full workflow documentation.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Check inbox
ai_mail inbox

# Send task with assistant routing
ai_mail send @branch "Subject" "Body" --reply-to @assistant --auto-execute

# Check assistant status
drone @assistant update

# Vector search (branch-filtered)
drone @memory_bank search "query" --branch DEV_CENTRAL

# Sync central files
bash devpulse/apps/sync-readme.sh
bash devpulse/apps/sync-plans.sh
```

---

## Working Here

This is a **conversation hub**, not a code factory.

- **Discuss** architecture, plans, direction
- **Deploy agents** for actual work (via @assistant workflow)
- **Read** central aggregations for system overview
- **Coordinate** cross-branch operations

When something needs building, spawn an agent to the appropriate branch.
