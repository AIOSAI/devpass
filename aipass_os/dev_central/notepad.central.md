Okay, I'm gonna add some notes on some things I thought of today and I will just list them off and then we can go from there Some of them may contradict stuff. We already discussed 

. So Json, configs. So we had the idea about like today's on Handling being in practice, but then I'm thinking Config Jason conflicts. They have to be local. So Do we just add like a Jason handlers like module in every branch? So they just deal with their own what they just work from the template as a base model and then beyond the template they can configure and customize their Jason patterns. Whoever they like, but at least we get the structure down

a model thinking like a registration module maybe in practice so or something like that not quite sure or maybe just registration module locally so locally they can handle their own and then we have to practice the one that basically hooks them all in globally not too sure 

my some of my ideas are like so for branches to be registered um the way we can register branches so for branch anywhere that a branch has an ID JSON that will class as being registered right so I think if a branch is has an ID that means it's a work in branch and it should go on the registry so all the all the registry has to do is just look around for ID tags and then the branch will auto register and that means it will come work across the board so it will auto register um like for AI mail anything that needs to be registered basically will just like pull all the tags and then it's ready system wired right 

I was thinking today about prax so I think so for modules they handle like so basically they have the default system like the Python logs as you were saying log I don't know what you call there and but when we want advanced login we they need to import prax right and now potentially if they want to register modules for other branches they need to connect to say prax registry so prax is like the global connection and monitor so all the modules say flow or branch operations they can work independently without having advanced logging and registry 

So let's say for branch operations, it can still operate, it can still create branches, and it will still be able to heal branches. It will still be able to delete branches, but what I won't be able to do is to do full system updates, right? It can update individual branches one by one, but when what practice will do, when it imports prax modules like the registry, then it will basically take a practice like a network of the internet. So when modules connect to prax, it gets system-wide, and connectivity so it can perform system-wide activities, you know? Oh yeah, this got me thinking a little bit better. Rather than be called like prax registry, we could call it prax connect. 

figure out the best way to do this. What I want to achieve, I want to just build modules in their house. They just work as if Pax doesn't exist, right? And they set up other modules when they build them their needs right to work independently as I said like adding the the module registry like what branch operations does so it can heal modules is perfect but the thing is because modules a lot of them a lot of modules register right they need registry so rather than every branch had their own like sophisticated registry system why don't we just make like pracs registry or whatever we want to call it that's where the complex is this a lie right so the module just builds the templates that it needs when it's working but instead branch but when it wants to work globally so for the update say branch operations update or whatever it's called it needs to connect to pracs to get the global registry I don't want like modules managing like global registry versus local registry I'm trying to figure this out but it's a little hard it's quite see just other things that kind of get the play because see the JSONs they're local they managed their I think we just make the JSON 3 JSON 100% local that the local log it's a local config and it's local data right so when we connect to to pracs then we get the global logs like so where we get advanced login where our logger statements are printed to the central location for for me to view right for the system to view they also print locally too so I think I think modules should handle their logs locally and then pracs the only connect pracs if you want to want those to see the global logs right if I want to watch through pracs then that's that's where pracs logger is for right or is it because it's local too oh this is a tough one I'm sorry 

so this will be kind of hard to figure out I guess we will eventually get up between us I just need to find a way to structure this out so I can map it out let's start understanding it more see I think we really need to define what practice is we start building and separating well I guess we can build in separate branches and when we're building our branch we might we might just work on the pull practice aside from that we're in consideration but the thing is I think we need to can we build our branches with the consideration leave and practice and then all we need to do is just import practice and that's that's it right then practice will give it local logs we'll give all the logers stuff right and then we'd have our system logs and then we can watch the system that way but can we just build our branches like normally and now have to worry about practice but obviously we're gonna we're gonna import practice into our into our modules as we're building them right how do we do this

<summary><strong>MEMORY_BANK</strong></summary>

**Source:** [notepad.md](vscode://file/home/aipass/MEMORY_BANK/notepad.md)
**Last Modified:** 2025-11-08 12:30:44

Okay, let me explain what the memory bank is going to be. The memory bank will be a store and almost archive a library, let's say, of all the
  memories that get rolled over. So for example, in, let's say, a local observation memory, we have a 600-line limit. So when we reach those 600
  lines, it's going to, although roll over, those memories into the memory bank, and then it's going to categorize them and put them in the correct
  place.  To be decided later once we design the memory bank 

  These notes that I'm building right now are to start that process of understanding what the memory bank will be So other areas all the memories actually all basically all AI memories. So we have Like the local memories the observations and we also have DOCUMENTS They also AI memories. They're like the long-term memories So as you can imagine documents, they can build up quite fast, right? You know, we could have several documents, but we don't need to, you know, hold on to every single document memory you have. Also, when they're just sitting in your documents, they become stale, and then it just becomes hard to manage. You know, imagine like a couple of months we could have 50 different documents in there. That's not, not cool, right? So we could have like a, say a maximum 10 documents, so that's 10 long term memories of all your recent work. You know, the most recent data, and this will all be in JSON too. Your memories in the documents will be JSON structure, so it'll be really easy to let out. We can have a registry system that rolls them off automatically and so forth. And also in documents, my idea is to make sure you don't make print, build them in markdown format. We will have breadcrumbs to give instructions, but so the idea is we have a blank ready to fill document, like an empty document. So when you fill that document there, and then as soon as it gets edited, a new empty document gets built in its place. So you always have a fresh new document with the layout structure already built there for you. So all you got to do is just fill in the blanks. Obviously, we'll have to design this system. So with the creation of a new empty document, your long term memory, you know, documents, they're like more in depth, you know, detailed information. You know, work that say some agents did, that's where they can dump their work, and then we can reference them. We don't need them in context, but they are extremely helpful for when we do work. They are separate from the plan system completely. Obviously, they're just different, but it's basically just a store for your work. But when they saw when they knew, let's say you go in there and you edit the empty document template, then as soon as that's edited, it starts a sequence that it provides. It copies a new empty template, and in that system, the trigger, it can count how many documents exist. And if it's less than 10, then it doesn't need to process, but if it's more than 10, then it will process those documents directly to the memory bank, where the memory bank will organize them and store them. 

  Now just to give you some context of the memory bank the future of the memory bank the memory bank will be this super storage library archive, whatever you want to call it and organized shared memory system our collective readable call it a place where all the branches dump their memories memories into one huge memory bank basically and the memory bank itself will be a full branch and it will have AI that will be there to organize it and the memory bank So we basically a system that we can search if we will have to make it into Have a vector database search So all the memories get processed and organized and categorized based off certain variables that we will decide and we will design and then when say you or I were like hey Didn't we work on this like six months ago? Remember we had the same issue Let's search the memory bank and see if we can pull any data or see if you pull any information about this And that will be very helpful 

  memory bank, it will it will manage things like so for observations, it will manage them separately, you know, like organize them in their own data space, then we'll organize the local memory. So, you know, our day-to-day work, and organize them in their own place. Also, plans. So when we process plans, currently plans push to the memory bank right now. They just, they get a short summary and then they give a, you know, like just at the top, it doesn't really do much to them, but that's fine. It's just, our plan was always all we can just search. We can see this, you know, the summary. And stuff like that. So, and they have like TRL tag and system. Maybe we do integrate TRL a little bit differently. We make it more advanced. But, Johnny, if you look at the memory bank, you can kind of tell what the file, where it came from, and what plan it was associated with just from the file. But we're probably going to go once that photo, whatever vector memory system. So, plans will process and then, um, documents will process all your memories will process. Um, yeah, anything worth saving, really. So, we could have like, you know, a technical, um, aspect to it, where, where we could start using tags in our documentation. You know, every time we make a plan, we have a tagging system already predetermined. So, so we can, so it can be categorized similar, you know, like, to the branch operations. And ID system, where we're starting to tag, like, the template and the modules are getting their tags, the branches, so we can, we can confidently just change names, like, same kind of concept, but a little bit different.
