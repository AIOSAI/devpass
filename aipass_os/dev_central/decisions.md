# Decision Log

A record of real decisions made during collaboration. Each entry captures the context, what Claude suggested, what Patrick chose, and the reasoning gap between them. Over time this builds a pattern library for autonomous decision-making across all branches.

**Format:** Newest entries at top. Record honest assessments - wrong calls are more valuable than right ones.

## Entries

### #001 - 2026-02-10 | Session 88 | Feel Good App
**Context:** History tab just shipped and working on phone. Snapshot taken. All ideas from Patrick's brain dump captured in observations + dev notes. Patrick asked "what's next?"

**Claude's call:** I would continue with the Feel Good App - specifically start on the next functional feature. The app is hot, it's on the phone, Patrick's engaged with it. Momentum matters. The remaining stub tabs (Insights, Settings) aren't urgent, but making the History tab richer (delete entries, expand/collapse, maybe a daily summary count) would give Patrick something tangible to use while walking around. Alternatively, I'd ask Patrick what feature he wants to actually USE next - because "what's useful to the person holding the phone" beats "what's next on a feature list."

**Patrick's call:** Same direction - continue with the app. Next up: Insights tab. Not perfection, just get it working. Use the docs/research folders for what insights should contain. No real infrastructure yet (no health data, no correlations engine), so placeholders for metrics we're considering. Settings tab left to Claude when the time comes.

**Alignment:** Strong alignment. Both saw momentum + active engagement as the driver. Patrick is reading every message this session (self-described as rare - usually 50% or less). That energy says "keep going on this."

**Lesson:** When Patrick is actively engaged and responding to everything, stay on that thread. Don't pivot to infrastructure or system work. Ride the wave.

### #002 - 2026-02-10 | Session 88 | Feel Good App
**Context:** History and Insights both working and confirmed on phone. 3 tabs functional (Log, History, Insights), 1 stub (Settings). v2.0 snapshot taken.

**Claude's call:** Settings tab next. Last stub, lightweight, rounds out all 4 tabs being functional. Clear data, about/version, placeholders for notifications and health toggles. Gets us to a "v1 functional" milestone.

**Patrick's call:** Same. Settings next. Be creative with placeholders based on our plans and research.

**Alignment:** Full alignment. Both see the value of completing all tabs before moving deeper.

**Lesson:** When there's an obvious "complete the set" move, just do it. Don't overthink.
